                <p class="text-lg">Ever get an email that just feels... off? Phishing is a sneaky cyberattack where bad guys pretend to be someone you trust – like your bank or a colleague – to trick you into giving away your private info. Think usernames, passwords, credit card details, that kind of thing.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li>They often use emails, but can also try text messages or even fake websites.</li>
                    <li>Their goal? Usually to steal your data, sneak malware onto your device, or just get unauthorized access to accounts.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="slide">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Different Flavors of Phishing Attacks</h2>
                <p class="text-lg">Phishing isn't just one thing – there are a few common types to watch out for:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> The classic! Bogus emails designed to look like they're from real companies or people you know.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> More targeted attacks aimed at specific people or within an organization. They often use personalized information to seem more legitimate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing attempts that come through SMS or text messages. Watch out for those!</li>
                    <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> This is phishing done over voice calls. Someone might call pretending to be tech support or a bank representative.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clone Phishing:</strong> Where they take a real, previously sent email and replace the links or attachments with malicious ones. Tricky!</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-lg">Keep your eyes peeled for these telltale signs in your inbox:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li>Did you get asked for sensitive info out of the blue? That's a big red flag.</li>
                    <li>Generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name.</li>
                    <li>Typos and bad grammar are common giveaways.</li>
                    <li>Take a close look at the sender's email address – does it seem a little off? Like "supp0rt@paypa1.com"?</li>
                    <li>They might try to scare you with urgent or threatening language, like "Your account will be suspended immediately!".</li>
                    <li>Be wary of links or attachments you weren't expecting. Think before you click!</li>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fake Websites: How to Tell If a Site's a Phish</h2>
                <p class="text-lg">Phishing sites often try to mimic the real deal. Here's what to look for:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li>URLs with slight misspellings are a classic trick. For example, "www.g00gle.com" instead of "www.google.com".</li>
                    <li>Is the "https://" missing, or is there no padlock icon in the address bar? That's not a good sign.</li>
                    <li>Poor design, blurry logos, or just an overall low-quality feel can indicate a fake site.</li>
                    <li>Did they suddenly ask for your login details or other personal information? Be extra cautious.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">Always double-check the website address before you type in anything sensitive.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">Phishers are masters of manipulation. They often play on your trust or emotions using tactics like:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> Inventing a believable story to get you to hand over information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baiting:</strong> Offering something tempting, like free stuff or software, that actually contains malware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tailgating:</strong> Physically following someone into a secure area without proper authorization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Pretending to be someone important, like a boss, IT support, or a vendor you work with.</li>

                <p class="text-lg">Here are some key steps you can take to protect yourself:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li>Always take a moment to verify the sender's email address before you reply or click anything.</li>
                    <li>Hover your mouse over links before clicking to see where they actually lead. If it looks suspicious, don't click!</li>
                    <li>Think twice before opening attachments, especially if you weren't expecting them.</li>
                    <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever you can for an extra layer of security.</li>
                    <li>Keep your software and antivirus programs up to date – they often include protection against the latest threats.</li>
                    <li>If you ever suspect a phishing attempt, report it to your IT department right away.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li>Becoming good at recognizing those suspicious emails, dodgy websites, and common tactics.</li>

                    <li>Being proactive and reporting anything that seems like a potential phishing attempt.</li>
